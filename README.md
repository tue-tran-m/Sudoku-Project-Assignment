# Sudoku-Project-Assignment
The project aims to create a Sudoku Solver with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to play Sudoku puzzles at three different difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that requires players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.

# Features: 
  1. Three Difficulty Levels:
  The Sudoku project offers three levels of difficulty - easy, medium, and hard. Each level presents a varying number of pre-filled cells or "holes" in the Sudoku grid, with easy having fewer holes compared to medium and hard levels, which progressively increase in difficulty.
  2. Interactive Gameplay Interface:
  The gameplay interface provides a user-friendly window where players can interact with the Sudoku grid. Players can navigate through the grid using mouse clicks or keyboard inputs.
  3. Keyboard Shortcuts:
  Press 'R' to restart and choose a different difficulty level.
  Press 'E' to exit the game.
  Press 'V' to reset the current puzzle, clearing all filled cells.
  4. How it work:
  Clicking on an empty cell and pressing a number on the keyboard will input the number into the cell.
  The entered number appears on the left side of the cell in a gray color, indicating a tentative entry.
  Pressing the 'Enter' key confirms the entry, and the number shifts to the center of the cell in black, signifying a finalized entry.
  5. Win Detection:
  Upon filling all cells correctly according to Sudoku rules, the program automatically detects the completion of the puzzle.
