# Sudoku-Project-Assignment
The project aims to create a Sudoku Solver with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows users to play Sudoku puzzles at three different difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. Sudoku is a popular logic-based puzzle game that requires players to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
